# MTA-Dataset: Multiple-tilt-angle Dataset for UAV-satellite Image Matching
A comprehensive benchmark for UAV-satellite image matching that covers a wide range of tilt angles spanning [0°, 90°). This dataset comprises 1,892 UAV images captured by diverse UAVs at various altitudes, complemented by a high-resolution (0.3m) reference satellite map. Each UAV image is annotated with the precise geographic coordinates of five keypoints across different regions.
